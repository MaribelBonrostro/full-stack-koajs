# NOK-004: Client Login

## Background

The team wants to build a UI to allow users to log in to their account. The UI should use the `POST /auth` endpoint and pass the entered users' credentials. When successful, the endpoint should return an access token to the client application, which the application should store in a cookie. The team suggests React, but are open to any preferred framework.

## Requirements

* Implement a UI that displays a login form in the `app/ui` directory
* Implement the logic to call the `POST /auth` endpoint of the API and connect this to the login page
* Set an expiring cookie to the correct time by the access token expiry provided by the API

## Task

Your task is to do the following:

1. Bootstrap a UI directory in `app/ui` that houses a client application
2. Create a login form in the client application
3. Add the logic to make a request against the API to retrieve authorisation
4. On successful login, store the access token in a cookie

### Extra Credit

* Ensure that the token is refreshed before it expires as long as the user is active on the site
* Determine how you would test and write test(s) for this feature.

## What you will be marked on

* Code readability, quality and styling
* Typescript use
* Understanding of the approach and use of tooling using for building the UI
* Documentation
* Testing approach
