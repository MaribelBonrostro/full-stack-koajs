# NOK-001: Containerising the API

## Background

The Account API isn't currently containerised, which is causing problems for engineers. The team have elected to take a docker-first approach to development.

## Requirements

* The `Dockerfile` should use multi-stage build
* The `Dockerfile` should produce an artefact that has minimal image size considerations
* The published artefact should be secured by embedded good practices for container security
* The image should not include any known vulnerabilities

## Task

Your task is to do the following:

1. Dockerise the API application by updating the `Dockerfile` in the `app/api` directory.
2. Provide any useful documentation/scripts to help the team with running the application using Docker
