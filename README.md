# Nokkel FullStack Tech Test

You have been assigned some tickets working across a new API and user interface (UI). These applications are decoupled microservices to be developed and deployed in isolation. (A monorepo approach has been used for this test, but you should try to treat them as independent services in your implementation). Please familiarise yourself with the API and UI using the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide before you begin.

While we recommend timeboxing this test to roughly 3 hours, there is no explicit time limit. We are more keen to see what you can do, so do feel free to take the time you need and note in the PR how much time you took to complete the test.

## What we are looking for

We want to see how you work and follow your thought process/thinking. Some actions that will help us do so are:

* Create a branch for your work and commit all your changes to this branch
* Create iterative commits to your branch that allows us to follow the steps you've taken within and for each ticket
* Add documentation, such as comments in your code or markdown documents that will help us to follow what you have done
* When you have completed your work, create a pull request and add any information into the PR that will help us evaluate your thinking/approach
